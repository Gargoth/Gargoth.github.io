Di ko rin talaga alam yung FSOG. Di ko rin talaga fave song ung Heaven by Julia Michaels from the OST. Pero look where we are now. We send so much random things to each other. We have become closer despite having a lot of different interests. I‚Äôm so thankful na we have built this friendship and made it stronger as time passed by. I know na magiging mas mahirap na buhay natin kasi we‚Äôre going to be in college already (yak kadiri. Di naman tayo mukhang college pa rin.).
