Heyy it's your favorite person in the ASHS here! So yeah, lots of stuff going on, I hope you're enjoying your birthday as well as what we've prepared for you HUEHUEHUE! (especially the website i worked hard on it, buti na lang tumulong si harvey goddamn im so proud of that website. especially the whole 'pink' aesthetic grrrr and the pixel art fbasndjkdfhjkd i hope you like slime-chan as much as i do HAHAHDJAHSKJHSJS it been worked on for at least 3 days)

HAAAPPYYYYY BIIIRTTHHHDAYYYY SA IYOO SEEEENGGBOSSSSS! ATEEE ANGELAAA!

You've always been someone who kept me coming back to school, it just do be like that you know? I mean ofc, I really had no choice but to go back to school, that's just how it works, but i have spent A LOT of my recess and lunch times going to Walpole (and getting mildly disappointed because you are a busy hamster). Those after school kwentuhans at the food place near your dorms were always something I looked forward to even when they are unplanned, it's usually just a feeling na 'uy mukhang kakain ulit kami ni angela ah' ya know? I ain't sure if it's just me who gets that feeling HAHAHAHA.

Wala ako masyadong kausap talaga dito sa condo so I think and look back on the days when di ako nauubusan ng kausap HAHAHAHA, and madalas ko talaga naaalala yung walang katapusang inside jokes natin, the heavy stuff we once worried so much about, etc (usually ginagamit ko 'etc' kapag wala na akong maisip na ibang example pero sadyang marami lang talaga dito HAHAHAHAH). Yea so what I wanted to say in this paragraph is that the time I spent with you was just really fun even if it was just two short years. Time is wack ya know, it's so fast when you're having fun or when you're looking back on experiences from the future, parang isang 'WOAH PARE' lang tapos na agad Ateneo life natin woah pare.

So yeaaa, IT EEZ WHAT IT EEZ, you do be old sometimes. Relatively, you are an ancient one. Right now you can finally look down on us, standing atop your pedestal of old age, seemingly one or more units higher than what the rest of us have. HAPPY BIRTHDAY ULIT HOPE WE STILL MEET UP A LOT IN UPD (ofc after quarantine na HEKHEKHEKHEK)!
